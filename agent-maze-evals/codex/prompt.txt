There is a mazes.json file in this folder with data about 2D grid mazes.

The file contents 10 mazes of varying difficulties. Each maze includes a JSON representation and different prompts which each contain different textual representations of the maze structure.

Your job is to produce valid move sequences for each maze, in a JSON output where the keys are the maze IDs and the values are the move sequence, e.g.
```json
{
  "0b298bb3-e470-43c6-bb42-017f4a15ab26": [ "DOWN", "UP", "UP", "RIGHT" ]
  ... etc.
}
```

You can use any tools and write and run any code to solve these mazes, but you must only work in this folder.

Note that the special instructions for each maze should be paid attention to closely.

Once done, output the final solution data to a file: solution.json.
